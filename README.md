# Globe Time App

## Description
    
The main motive behind to make this App was to show the Time data of diffrent country of all over the Globe live. So I have used WorldTime API to show the Time data in my App.
      
[World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) is a simple web service which returns the local time for a given timezone. (is Currently in Daylight Savings time, when DST start and ends the UTC offset etc.)
      
The API returns JSON Adding a suffix of .txt to any API, url will return a plane_text response.
